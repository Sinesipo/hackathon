        "* The dataset for this challenge is very large and will take a long time to process. In order to use your time wisely, only use a small subset of the data to figure out how to solve this challenge, and once you're happy with that, train your model with the entire dataset.\n",
        "* This Zindi challenge is tough. This will be taken into account when the supervisors mark your work. Do not worry too much about your placement on the leaderboard. In the Regression Hackathon ```laura_the_explorer``` was in first place but is outside the top 100 in this challenge\n",
        "* To submit your Hackathon to Athena, zip your notebook and your submission csv file, and upload that here. Note that your report card will say you have 100% once you submit your file.\n",
